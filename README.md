# Peroxide Studio (PXC)

Peroxide Studio is an open-source community project building a fair way to turn **real gaming participation** into **verifiable reputation** and **community rewards** — with the long-term goal of helping gamers access games and events at a lower effective cost through sponsorships, community pools, and transparent rules.

This is a builder-first project. The token (PXC) is treated as **optional utility**, not an investment product.

## What we’re building

### 1) Proof-of-Play (verification layer)
A lightweight system that can verify gaming activity using public signals (APIs, screenshots, match IDs, tournament records, etc.) with clear anti-cheat rules.

### 2) Reputation and roles
A reputation score that reflects:
- participation (showing up)
- contribution (helping others)
- competitive results (optional)
- community trust over time

### 3) Rewards that don’t rely on hype
Rewards are designed to be sustainable:
- community-funded prize pools
- sponsor-funded giveaways
- event access and perks
- optional token utility (not required)

## Why this matters
Game prices are rising and monetization is aggressive. Gamers generate value (community, competition, content), but usually don’t benefit from it. Peroxide Studio aims to build a transparent, open alternative that rewards real participation without turning the community into an extraction machine.

## What this is NOT
- Not a “get rich quick” coin
- Not a promise of profits or returns
- Not financial advice
- Not pay-to-win

## Current status
Early-stage. We’re focusing on:
- documentation
- rules + verification methods
- a working prototype
- growing contributors
