# Peroxide Studio – Vision

Peroxide Studio is an open-source community coordination framework designed to reduce the financial barriers of gaming by rewarding participation, skill, and contribution rather than speculation or pay-to-win mechanics.

Modern gaming ecosystems increasingly rely on monetization models that prioritize microtransactions, exclusive content, and rising upfront costs. This disproportionately affects younger players, lower-income communities, and competitive gamers who invest time and skill but receive no tangible return. Peroxide Studio aims to counter this trend by creating transparent, verifiable systems that recognize player engagement and achievement as a measurable contribution.

The project focuses on building open infrastructure that allows gaming communities to:
- Verify participation across competitive, cooperative, and casual games
- Track achievement, ranking, and engagement using public or community-validated sources
- Distribute shared benefits based on contribution rather than capital
- Maintain transparency through open-source tools and auditable policies

Peroxide Studio does not position itself as an investment product or speculative token ecosystem. Instead, it treats tokens as an accounting and coordination mechanism for community benefit distribution, experimentation, and incentive alignment.

By leveraging Ethereum’s transparency and open standards, Peroxide Studio seeks to create a reproducible model that other communities can adapt—supporting fairer access to gaming experiences while fostering collaboration, accountability, and long-term sustainability.
