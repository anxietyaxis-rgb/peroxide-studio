# Verification Sources (Draft)

Goal: verify participation without requiring private data.

Possible sources:
- Steam profile + playtime (public)
- Match IDs / tournament brackets
- Public leaderboard URLs
- Screenshot proof (with timestamp + username)
- Clip links (optional)
- Third-party trackers (Apex, Valorant, Fortnite, etc.) when public

Anti-abuse:
- minimum account age rules
- rate limits
- manual review for suspicious claims
- transparent penalties
